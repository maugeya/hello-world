Hi, I'm Angela. Started out coding as a hobby but wanting to change careers into web development after finding it as a way of being able to get out my creative side AND do something productive! Started this year doing a few online courses and now looking into getting some funding to be able to complete a bootcamp. I identify myself as a mixed race lesbian and so I want to find an in into the industry and hopefully show others that are the same that this work is available to us and be able to use the skills that I learn to put towards worth while causes!
